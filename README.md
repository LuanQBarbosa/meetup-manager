## ðŸ’» About 

 The Meetup Management application is a Next.js project developed with the purpose of practicing front-end development using the framework. The main goal of the application is to offer a way for the user to search and register future meetups, giving some simple informations about it. The app is using the MongoDB database and the backend code is all contained on this codebase, using the available Next.js resources to do it.
